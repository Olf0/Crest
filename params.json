{"name":"Crest","tagline":"Simple top like application for SailfishOS","body":"Crest\r\n=====\r\n\r\nAbout application\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nTop like application. Show applications/processes on your cell phone sorted\r\neither by CPU or memory usage. You can also terminate/kill selected process.\r\nCover page shows average load.\r\n\r\n*Important notice*:\r\n\r\n* Do not kill stuff unless you know what you are doing, can lead into lot of\r\n  troubles.\r\n* Memory column shows RSS (Resident Set Size) which is not a real memory usage.\r\n  It includes shared resources, so the number is typically bigger.\r\n* Average load doesn't mean CPU utilization as it includes processes waiting\r\n  for io as well. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)[wikipedia].\r\n\r\nCurrent status of application is somewhere around beta. It works and it's not\r\ngonna eat your kittens (if you are careful), but there might be (and probably\r\nare) bugs. Especially regarding filtering apps. If you have a good (specific\r\nand implementable) idea how to improve the application, let me know. Patches\r\nare also very welcome.
