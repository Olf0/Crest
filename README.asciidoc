About application
-----------------

Top like application. Show applications/processes on your cell phone sorted
either by CPU or memory usage. You can also terminate/kill selected process.
Cover page shows average load.

*Important notice*:

* Do not kill stuff unless you know what you are doing, can lead into lot of
  troubles.
* Memory column shows RSS (Resident Set Size) which is not a real memory usage.
  It includes shared resources, so the number is typically bigger.
* Average load doesn't mean CPU utilization as it includes processes waiting
  for io as well. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)[wikipedia].

Current status of application is somewhere around beta. It works and it's not
gonna eat your kittens (if you are careful), but there might be (and probably
are) bugs. Especially regarding filtering apps. If you have a good (specific
and implementable) idea how to improve the application, let me know. Patches
are also very welcome. Direct both to https://github.com/miska/Crest[github].
